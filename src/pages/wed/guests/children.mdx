Waaaaah! Look there's going to be a small church ceremony and a lot of babies,
toddlers, and children in attendance.

- The Babies (2 and unders)'s advocate : Dr Alex Riddal
- The Children (3 and up)'s advocate : Anna Taylor

Who will be running the Youth Advocacy WhatsApp Group. And storing the detail here...

Things in our favour:

- Christopher and Caterina live a short walk from the church?? So maybe we can
  set up a creche there
- Maybe David and Miranda's garden instead?

## Updates and Bulletins

None so far

## FAQ

### Are children welcome?

Yes

### Are babies welcome?

Yes

### Why!?! Why!?! Why?

To be honest, it's because the people we'd use for childcare are likely to be
invited as guests to the wedding. So if our child has to be there, there might
as well be more rotters about!

### Sun Protection?

Let's crowdsource this one.... sounds like a great idea for Alex and Anna to work
on.
