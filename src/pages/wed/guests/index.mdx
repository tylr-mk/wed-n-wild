You beautiful people: our friends, family, and, even better, colleagues! The creme de
la creme of the best chapters of our lives.

## What We Need from You

Fill in your RSVPs on this site including dietary stuff!

## Save The Dates, RSVPs, Invites, Favours, Keepsakes

We'll send what and when we can! But honestly these are the last thing we're going
to prioritise. I'm sure we love you and very much value you sharing this time with us
but please don't expect anything like this or anything very good.

## Codes & Expectations

### What to Wear

Let's be clear ! Come dressed as you like, the day is for celebration and memories,
and a big part of that is your joy and comfort. Wear what brings you joy! And please
know there's going to be piles of children under 10 in attendance and if you find
it funny please put them in bow ties and shades but there's no obligation.

Venetia plans on providing an award to the guest wearing the most denim! If you think
you have a chance against the groom, good luck to you. We also won't be throwing a
bouquet or garter but instead we'll bestow the "next to marry" title to the guest with
the most exquisite hat. And keep your socks on in prep for a round of bird bingo ! 

### How to Join In

This is going to be a family-oriented event! Under-5s are going to make up about 20%
of the attendees. We will be subject to the pile or the swarm.... maybe there'll be
napping areas?

#### Celebrations

Christopher and Caterina Goodhart are the hosts of the celebrations and will be 100%
on that one.
