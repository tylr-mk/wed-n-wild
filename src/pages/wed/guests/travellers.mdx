Okay. There's plenty people coming from far afield and plenty coming from London. Again,
I'm going to defer this responsibility to advocates...

## FAQ

### What is London?

London is the UK's capital city. It's a big city in the south east of England.

### What is Richmond?

Richmond is a bougie suburb of London. It's where some of us live. It's where the
wedding is.

### Is Richmond in London?

The last response was a lie. Richmond is easily the least in London borough of
all London boroughs. It is a pretender. It is however a small town that can
be reached from London pretty easily ~20mins from Waterloo or at the end of
the District Line. And in fairness is the most London London borough being
populated largely by bankers, aging rock stars, and the Branson family.

### Where should we stay?

My friend! That is what the traveller advocacy group is for; hopefully you can
find suitable accommodation. Maybe we'll try pile all the children into one
sleepover spot and have the grandparents look after them? I'm over thinking
this... but that would be sweet if at all possible.

### Coming to London is a big ask!

Oh my do I know that. And unfortunately we're all adults so kipping on people's
floors isn't a major option for many of us. Regardless, there will be a couple
rooms going spare and enough people coming down to maybe book out an AirBnB?
