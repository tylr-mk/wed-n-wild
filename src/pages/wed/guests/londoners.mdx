There's also some losers joining us from London... I have no idea how a midnight end to
a night sounds to you people. So for anyone wanting to go on... Im going to defer this responsibility to advocates...

* The London Advocate : Davinia Goodhart

Who will be running the Londoners Advocacy WhatsApp Group

## Updates and Bulletins

None so far

## FAQ

### When will this end?

About midnight but if you're inclined maybe Davinia will find a club night for you
monsters.

### Will it really end that early?

Hopefully?? Or at least I won't know, I'll be asleep already and I can guarantee
Venetia will be also.

### No one coming is in their 20s

I know, I know, I'm sorry. I'm old. I'm tired. There's going to be no one for Joe
Hepworth to talk to. I'm sorry.
