I really hope you know who we are! Finding this site and spending any time on it
otherwise is just weird... But in celebration of the two of us you may be aware that:

- at the foot of the tallest mountain
- along the most malign canyon
- before the raddest sculpture

...of Canada, Dr Venetia Honor Lola Amelia Goodhart turned and, to her whole-hearted
susprise, found Mike on bended knee. With the fair choices of getting married or
having to run away and fend off the grizzly bears of British Columbia and surviving
only on Canadian pizza, the good doctor took the braver option and said yes. So we're
getting married.

We've been together for two years and wow has that time flown:

1. living together from month 6
2. buying a mattress month 12
3. buying a bed frame month 18
4. buying a kitchen month 24
5. expecting a new bundle of joy month 27

## The Family

Look a these beautiful people! Especially, take a real long good look at your fit hosts
Christopher and Caterina Goodhart.

## How to use this Site

We'll use a combination of this site, WhatsApp, and email to keep details up to date
and full. We recommend visiting this site for fixed details but sign up to the WhatsApps
to be notified of updates.

- Getting Wed
- Getting Wild

We also want to manage the RSVPs and dining requests through this site so please keep
your RSVPs up to date.

## The General Theme

It's London and we're asking for a Friday from many of you. So we'll try our best to
bundle up our celebrations into Friday / Saturday at most and get you off home by Sunday.
And in that time we'll have our Wedding and Stag celebrations! Please note there's
lots of children and hopefully quite a few people milling about. So if you're not
attending the Stag / Hen there'll be some childcare you can help us with or you
can take you're on free time in London. Absolutely, no bother x
